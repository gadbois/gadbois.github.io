> This page is a static page for an entirely static site. It follows on purpose a minimalistic approach, using MultiMarkdown with [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com/) for the output in html. It started as an experiment (proof-of-concept) for a one-source publishing approach to creating class material (i.e., from one plain text document, produce a web page, a slide deck (using [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/)), and a PDF document). All the (Multi)Markdown files (plain text files) were created and edited with a number of different text editors over the past 3 years (e.g., [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), [ByWord](https://bywordapp.com/), [MultiMarkdown Composer](https://multimarkdown.com/composer4/), [Typora](https://typora.io/)). Functionality, speed, small bandwidth and footprint are the goal. The html produced by markdown (any of its flavour) is clean and uncluttered.
